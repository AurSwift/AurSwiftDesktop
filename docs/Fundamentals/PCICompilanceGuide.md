## Your Current Situation

You built an Electron.js app for a client with:

- ✅ Stripe Terminal SDK integration
- ✅ BBPOS Wisepad 3 (simulated)
- ✅ Testing with simulator

## Who Needs PCI Compliance?

### **YOUR CLIENT** needs PCI compliance - NOT YOU (the developer)

```
YOU (Developer) → Built the software → CLIENT (Supermarket) → Uses it to process payments
                                    ↑
                          CLIENT needs PCI, not you
```

## The Simple Breakdown

### **Your Responsibility** (as Developer):

- Build secure software that uses Stripe Terminal properly
- Don't store credit card data
- Use Stripe's SDK correctly
- Hand over a compliant application

### **Client's Responsibility** (as Business Owner):

- Complete annual PCI paperwork (SAQ A-EP)
- Basic computer security in their store
- Network security
- Employee training
- Potentially pay for security scans

## Real-World Example

**Think of it like building a car:**

- **You** = Car manufacturer (build secure vehicle)
- **Client** = Car owner (must get insurance, follow traffic laws, maintain the car)

## What You Should Do Now

### 1. **Document Your Security**

```plaintext
Write a simple document explaining:
- "This app uses Stripe Terminal"
- "Card data never touches our servers"
- "We follow Stripe's security guidelines"
```

### 2. **Educate Your Client**

Tell them:

- "You need to complete annual PCI paperwork (SAQ A-EP)"
- "This costs little to nothing if you're small"
- "Stripe handles most of the security for you"

### 3. **Hand Over the Project**

- Deliver the software
- Provide basic security documentation
- Move on to your next project

## The Money Question

### **Do YOU need to pay for PCI?**

**NO!** - Your client pays for their own compliance.

### **What might your client pay?**

- **Small business**: $0-200/year (mostly their time)
- **Medium business**: $200-1,000/year (optional security scans)
- **Large business**: $1,000+/year (required security services)

## What PCI Actually Looks Like for Your Client

### **For a Small Supermarket:**

1. **Once a year**: Fill out 10-page form (SAQ A-EP) - **FREE**
2. **Basic security**: Antivirus, updates, strong passwords - **FREE**
3. **Optional**: Network security scan - **$100-200/year**

### **That's literally it!**

## Common Misconceptions

### ❌ "PCI compliance costs thousands"

**TRUTH**: Only for huge companies processing millions

### ❌ "I need to buy expensive services"

**TRUTH**: Most small businesses just fill out a form

### ❌ "As a developer, I'm responsible"

**TRUTH**: The business owner using the software is responsible

## Your Action Plan

### Step 1: Finish Development

- Keep using Stripe Terminal correctly
- Test with simulator
- Deliver to client

### Step 2: Basic Documentation

- Write 1-page security summary
- Explain they need SAQ A-EP annually
- Provide Stripe's PCI resources

### Step 3: Get Paid & Move On

- Your job is done
- Client handles their own compliance
- You built a secure system

## Bottom Line

**You're fine!** You built the software correctly using Stripe Terminal.

**Your client** needs to handle their own PCI paperwork, which is simple and cheap for small businesses.

**You don't pay anything.** You don't need to do anything else beyond delivering a secure application.

Does this clear up the confusion? You're in a good position!
