A salt is a random value added to a password (or PIN) before hashing it. This makes each hash unique, even if two users have the same password or PIN. Using a salt protects against precomputed attacks (like rainbow tables) and makes it much harder for attackers to crack passwords if the database is compromised. In your code, bcrypt generates and uses a salt for secure password and PIN storage.
